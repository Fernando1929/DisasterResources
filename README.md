## Disaster Resources Locator App

This is the disaster resources management web application, developed as term project for the UPRM Database Systems course (FY 2019-2020, Spring Semester).

**For Phase 1:**<br/> 
The repository includes the app database's ER diagram, a written report describing such diagram, and the necessary backend code.<br/>
The *backend* directory includes the DAOs and handlers needed for each entity, and the *main* file containing all the application's routes.

**For Phase 2:**<br/> 
The repository now includes updated versions of the ER diagram and written report, and a *schema.sql* file with all the necessary CREATE TABLE queries. Our PostgreSQL database backup file was added, and the *dbconfig* file has been updated with the necessary credentials.<br/>
In addition, a Postman collection of routes tests was also included.<br/>
Finally, the DAOs and handlers for the backend code were updated, replacing hard-coded JSON data with database queries.
